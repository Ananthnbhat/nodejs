2 types of sending data on request
1 using app.send
another, using express middleware which gives the file directory to the server which accesses the file in that directory
**middleware-accesses req and res objects,modifies them if required(if you want express to do something which is not there in express,
you can teach it using middleware)
app.use is used to register the middlware.
(middleware,partial,helper which helps partials)
**template (view) engine-handlebars
*hbs plugin(3rd party module)is used to wrap/implement handlebars in nodejs
**views is the default dir express uses for templates.
*to display/render a template use res.render('filenmae.hbs')//hbs for handlebars
**Handlebars allows for reuse of some code/template through partials.
 Partials are normal Handlebars templates that may be called directly by other templates. 
hbs.registerPartials(__dirname + '/views/partials');
**hbs.registerHelper('getCurrentYear',()=>{
    return new Date().getFullYear();
}); Helper can be used to help a partial

**the definition of middleware should have next(); at the end,otherwise the process wont proceed.
**middleware is executed in the order in which app.use is written

**install git
git --version(in node-web-server in git bash)
git init
git status- to check the status of the files
git add server.js
git add package.json
create a .gitignore file in node-web-server(root) and write
node-modules
server.log
in that file so that git will ignore any changes done to thos files.
then,
git add .gitignore
at the end,save
git commit
git push-to push the saved git to github
**creating ssh key
to create- $ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096 -C "email@gmail.com"
to check whether key is present or not-$ls -al ~/.ssh
id_rsa is the private key
id_rsa.pub is the public key
to know the presence of ssh agent-$eval "$(ssh-agen -s)"
to add the ssh key to ssh agen-$ssh-add ~/.ssh/id_rsa
to copy the public key to clipboard-$clip <~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub and paste it in ssh page in github to add the new ssh key.

**heroku-create account,download heroku cli,login in git bash using $heroku login
then-$herku keys:add
add the key,say yes
then-$ssh -v git@heroku.com to connect git to heroku?

**changes made to the code so that it can be run by heroku
see the code

**after some definite changes to the code,do
git add 
git commit -m 'message'
git push

**to create heroku app
heroku create
git push heroku-to deploy to heroku
